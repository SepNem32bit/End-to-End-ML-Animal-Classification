#The @ensure_annotations decorator in Python is typically used to enforce that the function adheres to its type annotations at runtime. It ensures that:
# The inputs to the function match the types specified in the function signature.
# The output of the function matches the return type annotation.
#A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its code.
#for example in this function inputs and outputs are integer. If we input any other data type, it'll give us an error
# get_multiplications(x=3,y="2")

#Base64 is an encoding scheme used to convert binary data into a string format made up of ASCII characters. 
#It is commonly used to encode data that needs to be safely transmitted over media designed to handle textual data, such as email or JSON. 
#This encoding ensures that binary data (like images, files, etc.) doesn't get corrupted when passed through systems that only accept text.
